# react-redux-registration-login-example


React + Redux - User Registration and Login with admin user role:

I have designed this project with bootstrap; implementing a user-friendly and responsive design. I have used some advance react and redux functions for updated code method. All code methods are user-friendly, so that you can easily edit them. I used PHP server for backed API.
All components are arranged in separate folders for the issue to be understandable. 
I also used separate folders for redux reducer, Constants, Helpers and Components.
